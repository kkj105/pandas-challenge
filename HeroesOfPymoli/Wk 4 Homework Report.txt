3 Observable Trends


1. In examining the Purchasing Analysis by Gender, I was surprised to see that while men outnumber women in the dataset, it’s women who, on average, spend more money per person. 
2. The dataset makes clear that the target audience to market to are: males, between the ages of 20-24. They make the most purchases and spend more money than any other age group. 
3. In looking at the Most Popular and Most Profitable Analyses, it was interesting to see that both have the same #1 item: “Final Critic”.  Followed very closely in both analyses by the #2 item: “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm”.
